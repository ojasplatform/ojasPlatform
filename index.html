<a name="welcome-to-ojas-platform" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-ojas-platform"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Ojas Platform.</h3>

<p>Ojas platform emerged out of trying to build a solution to detect and prevent data leaks from web applications. Traditional WAFs are good at protecting OWASP top 10 but do little more than that. Our goal was to go beyond that and build something that allows web developers/DevOps folks to test and deploy more robust Web Applications. We figured if we could enable them to leverage the <code>state of the art</code> machine learning algorithms to understand how their apps are being used and use this knowledge to detect anomalous interactions with the apps, then we would enable them to build more robust and secure services. </p>

<h3>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>As a result what we set out to build ended up being a near real-time system that inspects packets streaming from some source(s). We set out by leveraging streaming big data tools such as <a href="https://storm.incubator.apache.org/">Storm</a> and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> and ingesting packets from a proxy such as <a href="http://mitmproxy.org">mitmproxy</a> or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">ratproxy</a>. However, we wanted both the correlation engine (storm/spark) and the proxies to be able to scale naturally by just increasing the computes dedicated to each of these functions. So we added <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> as our message broker that allowed the proxies to serve content to our correlation engine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our fundamental goal was to be able to apply the <strong>search</strong> metaphor to packets and to be able to correlate incoming packets across a massive dataset of previously recorded signals (from IDS, WAFs, FWs etc.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also wanted folks to quickly try it out and extend it to fit their own custom environments/use-cases and hope to standardize the platform as more feature-requests emerge. To that effect, we have created a [all-in-one vm] that you could download and run locally. The VM contains all the tools installed and pre-configured using a single setup script. We also provide a simple <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> dashboard that polls a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> REST server that in turn queries an underlying <a href="https://mongodb.org">Mongo</a> datastore. </p>
